            <h2 style="text-align: center; color:#fadd07; font-size:40px">How to get started with residential solar?</h2>
            <p>When it comes to solar installation, there are a few things you need to know in order to get started. The first thing is that not every home is a good candidate for solar installation. You’ll need to do an assessment of your home to see if it’s feasible.</p>
            <p>The next step is to find a qualified solar installer. It’s important to choose someone who is reputable and has a lot of experience installing solar systems. You’ll want to ask the installer for references so you can see what other people have said about their work.</p>
            <p>Once you’ve chosen an installer, they will help you select the right system for your home. There are a variety of options available, so you’ll want to make sure you pick the right one for your home. There are different types of panels, inverters, and batteries available as well as the type of solar panel you choose.</p>
            <p>The first thing that needs to be done is an assessment of your home’s power usage. This will give you a good idea of what size system you need so it can provide enough energy for your home. The installer will then do a physical inspection of your home to make sure that it’s in good condition and ready for solar installation.</p>
            <p>Once you’ve got everything set up, the next step is to decide how many panels you want to be installed on your roof. You may need more or less depending on the size of your house and the amount of sunlight that is available.</p>
            <p>Once everything is in place, you’ll need to choose a qualified installer to install your solar system. Make sure they have experience and can get the job done right the first time around. It’s important that they are insured and bonded so if something goes wrong, you won’t be stuck paying for the damages.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Having a commercial solar installation can be a great way to reduce your company’s carbon footprint and save money on your energy bills. Not only that, but it can also make your business more sustainable and attractive to customers and investors alike.</p>
                <p>A commercial solar installation is a great way to reduce your company’s carbon footprint. By installing solar panels on your property, you can cut down on the amount of electricity you use from the grid, which in turn reduces the amount of greenhouse gas emissions you produce. In addition, many states offer tax credits and other incentives for businesses that install solar panels, so you can save even more money on your energy bills.</p>
                <p>Solar panels can also help make your business more sustainable. By generating your own electricity, you don’t need to rely on grid power as much, and so you’ll save money on your energy bills. Plus, solar panels can be installed anywhere that gets sunlight, including places without access to a traditional electricity source.</p>
                <p>Solar panels are also an attractive investment for both businesses and individuals because they provide long-term savings over the life of the system. Panels typically have a lifespan of around 25-30 years, so you’ll continue to save money on your energy bills for decades after you install them.</p>
                <p>If you’re interested in installing a commercial solar installation, contact us today to learn more about our services. We can help you evaluate your property and determine the best way to install solar panels to meet your needs.</p>
